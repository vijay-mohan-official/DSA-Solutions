Palindrome :
Negative numbers and numbers ending in 0 (except 0) can't be palindromes

No need to reverse the whole number :
Take the last digit and build a reversed version, one digit at a time.
Stop when you’ve reversed half of the number.
Then check: is the start of the number the same as the reversed end?



Two sums :
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find two numbers such that they add up to target.
Return their indices.
Assumption:
There is exactly one solution, and you can't use the same element twice.

1. Initialize an empty HashMap to store numbers and their indices.
2. Loop through the array from index 0 to n - 1.
3. Calculate the complement: complement = target - current_number.
4. Check if the complement exists in the HashMap.
  If it does, return the index of the complement (from the map) and the current index.
5. If not found, store the current number and its index in the HashMap.
6. Repeat steps 2–5 until a valid pair is found.
