Palindrome
Negative numbers and numbers ending in 0 (except 0) can't be palindromes

No need to reverse the whole number :
Take the last digit and build a reversed version, one digit at a time.
Stop when youâ€™ve reversed half of the number.
Then check: is the start of the number the same as the reversed end?
