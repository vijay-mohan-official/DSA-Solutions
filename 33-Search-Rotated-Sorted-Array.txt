Question
-> Given a sorted and rotated array A of N distinct elements which is rotated at some point, and given an element key.
   The task is to find the index of the given element key in the array A.
Ans) Since the array is rotated and not sorted, we cannot directly proceed with binary search.
Step 1 : We need to find the pivot.
Step 2 : If we get the pivot, we can do binary search on each of the two array segments to find our element.

How to find the pivot?
{5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3}
The above is a rotated array, see the trend.
In a rotated array, see from 5 to 10, value keeps on increasing.
Then suddenly, after 10, it suddenly decreases to 1.
This sudden decrease in value is what we should use to find the pivot.
